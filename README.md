This tool was built to manage endpoint agents in ThousandEyes and can perform several common tasks needed in an organization. The tool has the ability to list and save all endpoint agents with details such as their assigned user, device, and model as well as agent state. State may be updated in the generated csv and used as a template to manage the endpoints.
